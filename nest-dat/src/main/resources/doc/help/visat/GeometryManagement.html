<h2>The Geometry Concept</h2>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;">As opposed to the bands and
            tie-point
            grids contained in satellite data products - which are all kinds of <i>raster data</i> - a geometry refers
            to
            <i>vector data</i>. Thus a geometry can be a point, line or polygon. Geometries
            are part of the a product's data model, and stored (restored) to (from)
            <a href="../readers/BeamDimapFormat.html">BEAM-DIMAP</a> product files. A product can comprise a number of
            named
            <i>geometry containers</i>. Each container may virtually comprise any number of geometries.
            New geometries are always added to the geometry container selected in <b>Geometries</b> node of the
            <a href="">Products View</a> tool window as shown in the screenshot the right.
            If there isn't a single geometry container yet,&nbsp;a default container named <b>geometry </b>will be created.&nbsp;
        </td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;">

    </tr>
</tbody></table>


<h2>Relationship with Pins and Ground Control Points (GCP)</h2>

<p>
    Pins and Ground Control Points are placemarks treated as point geometries. Thus, geometry editing such as moving or
    deleting is the same as for other geometries as described below in chapter 'Working with Geometries'. Despite this,
    the pins and GCPs of a data product are still managed as described in
    <a href="PinManagement.html">Pin Management</a> and <a href="GcpManagement.html">GCP Management</a>, respectively.
</p>

<h2>Relationship with Masks and Regions of Interest (ROI)</h2>

<p>
    The geometries in a geometry container can be directly used as a ROI for raster data analysis.
    The way how this is established is closely related to the new <a href="MaskROIManagement.html">Mask and ROI
    Management</a>.
    Once a new geometry container has been added to the data product, an associated <i>geometry mask</i> is created by
    rendering the geometry onto the product's intrinsic raster data grid.
</p>

<div align="center">
    <table>
        <tbody><tr>
            <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/GeometryPlain.png" alt="Geometry Plain"></td>
            <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/GeometryROI.png" alt="Geometry ROI"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td style="border-width: 0pt;" align="center">Polygon geometry (vector data)</td>
            <td style="border-width: 0pt;" align="center">Resulting mask (raster data)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody></table>
</div>
<p>
    The associated mask will always have the
    same name as the geometry container which created it and can serve as possible ROI for the selected band or
    tie-point
    grid without any additional user interaction.
    Once the geometry is created (e.g. simply by drawing it, see below), its associated geometry mask can be used as ROI
    in the various analysis tools, such as the <a href="StatisticsDialog.html">Statistics</a>,
    <a href="HistogramDialog.html">Histogram</a>, and <a href="ScatterplotDialog.html">Scatter Plot</a> tool windows.
    Multiple geometry ROIs can be defined by creating new geometry containers as described below.
</p>

<h2>Working with Geometries</h2>

<h3>Creating a new geometry</h3>

<p>
    Once you have opened an image view, new geometries are created by using the various drawing tools provided through the <b>Interactions Toolbar</b>:
</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/DrawLineTool24.gif" alt="Line"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><b>Line</b>: Press left mouse button for the start point, drag line to end point and
            release left mouse button.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/DrawPolylineTool24.gif" alt="Polyline"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><b>Polyline</b>: Single-click (press and release) left mouse button for the start
            point, move line segment and click to add a
            vertex point, move to end point and double-click to finalize the polyline.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/DrawRectangleTool24.gif" alt="Rectangle"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><b>Rectangle</b>: Press left mouse button for the start point, drag line to end point
            and release left mouse button.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/DrawEllipseTool24.gif" alt="Ellipse"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><b>Ellipse</b>: Similar to rectangle; Press left mouse button for the start point,
            drag line to end point and release left
            mouse button.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/DrawPolygonTool24.gif" alt="Polygon"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><b>Polygon</b>: Similar to polyline; Single-click (press and release) left mouse
            button for the start point, move
            line segment and click to add a vertex point, move to end point and double-click to close the polygon.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p></p>


<h3>Creating a new geometry container</h3>

<p>
    Use the menu item <b>Tools / Create Geometry Container</b> or the corresponding tool button from the
    <b>Interaction Toolbar</b> to create a new geometry container.
</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/NewVectorDataNode24.gif" alt="Container"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;">Clicking the button opens a dialog for creating a new geometry container.
            You will be prompted to enter a unique name for the new container.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>


<h3>Editing geometries</h3>

<p>
    Geometries may be edited in a number of ways once they have been selected. Note that editing or deleting a geometry
    will automatically affect the mask associated with the geometry's container.
    Use the <b>Select</b> tool to select geometries which shall be edited:
</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/icons/SelectTool24.gif" alt="Select"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;">Select a single geometry by clicking it. Select one or more geometries by dragging a
            selection
            rectangle around them. Hold down the <b>control</b> key while selecting in order to add or remove
            geometries from the current selection set.
        </td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Clicking selected geometries multiple times lets them step through a number of selection modes allowing for different
    editing modes which are further described below.
</p>

<table>
    <tbody><tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/GeometrySelMode1.png" alt="Geometry Selection Mode 1"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/GeometrySelMode2.png" alt="Geometry Selection Mode 2"></td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;"><img src="images/GeometrySelMode3.png" alt="Geometry Selection Mode 3"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;" align="center">Selection mode 1</td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;" align="center">Selection mode 2</td>
        <td style="border-width: 0pt;" align="center">Selection mode 3</td>
    </tr>
</tbody></table>


<p>
    <b>Move:</b> Selected shapes can be moved to another location simply by dragging them with the mouse.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Move vertex:</b> If single selected geometries are clicked once again, the selection mode changes depending on
    the
    geometry type. The first mode lets you move the vertexes of lineal and polygonal geometries by dragging the
    appearing
    vertex handles.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Scale:</b> The next selection mode (click again) lets you scale the size of a geometry by dragging the
    appearing size handles.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Cut, Copy, Paste:</b> Use these commands from the <b>Edit</b> menu or use the keys <b>Control X</b>,
    <b>Control C</b>, <b>Control V</b> to cut or copy geometries into the operating system's clipboard and
    to paste them into the same or another view.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Delete:</b> Use the command from the <b>Edit</b> menu or use the <b>Delete</b> key.
</p>


<h3>Importing geometry data</h3>

<p>
    You can use the <a href="ImportGeometry.html">Import Geometry</a> command to import geometries from
    <i>plain text files</i> or from <i>ESRI Shapefiles</i>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>Plain text (*.txt):</b> Imports a single geometry (polyline or polygon) from a plain text file
    having the format described in <a href="ImportGeometry.html">Import Geometry</a>.
</p>

<p>
    <b>ESRI Shapefile (*.shp)</b>: Multiple geometries can be imported from a Shapefile.
    The geometry coordinates used in the Shapefile will be converted to the coordinates reference system used by the
    current data product. Note that there is only&nbsp;limited support regarding the various style settings which
    may be attached to a specific Shapefile. It also currently ignore all the attribute data that usually
    comes with a Shapefile.&nbsp;
