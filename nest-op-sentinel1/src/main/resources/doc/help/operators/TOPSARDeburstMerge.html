<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">For the
TOPSAR IW
and EW SLC products, each product consists of one image per swath per
polarization. IW products have 3 swaths and EW have 5 swaths. Each
sub-swath
image consists of a series of bursts, where each burst was processed as
a
separate SLC image. The individually focused complex burst images are
included,
in azimuth-time order, into a single subswath image, with black-fill
demarcation in between, similar to the ENVISAT ASAR Wide ScanSAR SLC
products.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">For IW, a
focused
burst has a duration of 2.75 sec and a burst overlap of ~50-100
samples. For
EW, a focused burst has a duration of 3.19 sec. Overlap increases in
range
within a sub- swath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Images
for all
bursts in all sub-swaths of an IW SLC product are re-sampled to a
common pixel
spacing grid in range and azimuth.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Burst
synchronisation is ensured for both IW and EW products.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Unlike
ASAR WSS
which contains large overlap between beams, for S-1 TOPSAR, the imaged
ground
area of adjacent bursts will only marginally overlap in azimuth just
enough to
provide contiguous coverage of the ground. This is due to the one
natural
azimuth look inherent in the data.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">For
GRD products, the bursts are concatenated and sub-swaths are merged
to form one image. Bursts overlap minimally in azimuth and sub-swaths
overlap
minimally in range. Bursts for all beams have been resampled to a
common grid
during azimuth post-processing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In
the range direction, for each line in all sub-swaths with the same
time tag, merge adjacent sub-swaths. For the overlapping region in
range, merge
along the optimal sub-swath cut. The optimal cut is defined from the
Noise
Equivalent Sigma Zero (NESZ) profiles between two sub-swaths</span><span style="" lang="EN-GB">. The
NESZ is provided in the product.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">If
the two NESZ profiles intersect inside the overlapping region, the
position of the intersection point is the optimal cut.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">If
the two profiles do not intersect, all the points in the overlapping
region are taken from the sub-swath that has the lowest NESZ over the
overlap
region.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="" lang="EN-GB">In
the azimuth direction, bursts are merged according to their zero
Doppler
time. Note that the black-fill demarcation is not distinctly zero at
the end or
start of the burst. Due to resampling, the data fades into zero and
out. The
merge time is determined by the average of the last line of the first
burst and
the first line of the next burst. For each range cell, the merging time
is
quantised to the nearest output azimuth cell to eliminate any fading to
zero
data</span></p>
